npm i corse 

STEP2:
require in index.js (server ) 
STEP3:
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "http://localhost:3000", 
  })
);

there is a problem in filtering color and size 
i.e=> color and size name name in VC  are uppercase but in db they lowercase

The useSelector hook is used to extract the state of a component from the redux 
store using the selector function. The useDispatch hook is used to update the state of the 
component and return a new state.
